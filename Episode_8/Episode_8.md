[Intro to Bare Metal Programming - Episode 8: USART](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzjz_9HEQRc&list=PLtQdQmNK_0DQ8KGcZ1BOPv-3RDPvtqJ1H&index=8)

In this 8th Bare Metal episode, we will switch to a different AVR® microcontroller, the AVR DD family of microcontrollers. 
We will set up the clock to use the internal 32.768kHz low-power oscillator and output the clock signal as a sanity check. 
We will then configure the USART peripheral to transmit characters and write HEX values to the terminal. Then we will 
create a user output stream and redirect printf to use our user define stream. Finally. we will send formatted strings to the terminal.
