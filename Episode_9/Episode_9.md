[Intro to Bare Metal Programming - Episode 9: Header and Source Files[(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xkb4OCcZHE&list=PLtQdQmNK_0DQ8KGcZ1BOPv-3RDPvtqJ1H&index=90)

In this episode we will break the USART driver from Episode 8 into header and source files. Using header and source files allows 
us to make our projects modular and we can reuse code so that we don't have to write every project from scratch. This also means 
that we can maintain our own library of drivers so we are not affected if an external library updates and breaks things. 
We will use header and source files in all of the episodes moving forward, and leverage them in our final project for this series.
