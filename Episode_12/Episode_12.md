In this 12th episode of the AVR Bare Metal programming series,    
Intro to Bare Metal Programming with the AVR-DD, we will cover: 
   - Creating driver to take ADC measurements
   - Set up thresholding window
   - Learn about oversampling and decimation to increase effective ADC resolution from 12-bits to 14-bits
   - Create driver to perform oversampling and decimation.
