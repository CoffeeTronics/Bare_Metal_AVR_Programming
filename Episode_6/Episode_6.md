[Intro to Bare Metal Programming - Episode 6: Low Power Measurements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxguJcMhpE4&list=PLtQdQmNK_0DQ8KGcZ1BOPv-3RDPvtqJ1H&index=6)

In this 6th episode of the bare metal programming series for the AVR® Tiny2, we will cover:  
   - Modifying the Curiosity Nano for Low Power Measurements
   - Learn how to connect a power supply and current meter
   - Measure current consumption
   - Compare to expected current consumption from datasheet  
   
Low-Power versions of the code from EP3, EP4, and EP5 is included in this repo.
