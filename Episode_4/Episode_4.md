[Intro to Bare Metal Programming - Episode 4: (Non)-Blocking Functions and Timers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxabz8PcgaU&list=PLtQdQmNK_0DQ8KGcZ1BOPv-3RDPvtqJ1H&index=4)


In this 4th episode of the bare metal programming series for the AVR® Tiny2 (ATtiny1627), we will cover:  
   - Setting up an I/O pin as an output  
   - Setting up Timer/Counter A to overflow every 1ms by accessing the datasheet and device header file  
   - Writing logic to determine if the Timer/Counter A Interrupt Overflow Flag has been set - Counting the number of overflows and determining appropriate datatype for counter  
   - Writing logic to toggle LED after 1000ms has elapsed
