[Intro to Bare Metal Programming - Episode 3: Blinking an LED with I/O Ports and Bitmasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gkuFxLUtjE&list=PLtQdQmNK_0DQ8KGcZ1BOPv-3RDPvtqJ1H&index=3)

In the 3rd episode of the bare metal programming series for the AVR® Tiny2 (ATtiny1627), we will cover: 
   - Setting up an I/O pin as an output
   - Toggling an onboard LED every second using the delay function (blocking function)
   - Using datasheet and masks from the header file
