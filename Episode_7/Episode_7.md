[Intro to Bare Metal Programming - Episode 7: Lowest Power Blinky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe6Gy0CRUi8&list=PLtQdQmNK_0DQ8KGcZ1BOPv-3RDPvtqJ1H&index=7)

In this 7th bare metal episode, we will make a low power Blinky using the Real Time Counter (RTC) and Periodic Interval Timer (PIT) 
and compare the current consumption to the Blinky projects in the previous videos. Then we will find the lowest possible current 
consumption for the Tiny2 in sleep mode. We will also use the Microchip Power Debugger to measure the current and to also calculate 
a battery life for our project.
